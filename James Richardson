I was recently informed of your company's vacant Front-End Web Developer position via indeed.com. Upon review of the job description I was confident that I could provide your company with the set of skills that you require for this position. 
 
While I consider myself intermediate in web development, I'm constantly learning new languages and their best practices. In the past six months I've been diligently learning Bootstrap, JavaScript, NodeJS, and Git. My mentor has helped me develop skill sets with these various languages and continues to do so on a weekly basis. My core strengths include, but are not limited to the following. 
 
- Strong communication and troubleshooting skills. 
- Manage multiple projects simultaneously. 
- Ability to continuously build on and share knowledge. 
- Advanced knowledge in HTML/CSS. 
- Always advancing knowledge in development languages and tools. 
 
I'm very eager put my development experience to use as a Front-End Developer with your company.  
 
I'm available for an interview at any time and would welcome the opportunity to meet you and your team. 
 
I've enclosed my current resume for your consideration and hope to hear from you soon. 
 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely,
